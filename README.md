How to run Mathematica test
The scripts in this directory make it possible to duplicate the tests
Step 1: download the files from the zip
Step 2: extract the files. Put them in your java workspace, they must go under a common
root
Step 3: Everything can be run a implemented from the Runner class.
Step 4: Follow the instructions provided by the scanners
Step 5: Call the getMathematicaCode() method in order to get the Mathematica code for the specific object you have constrcuted.
Step 6: Copy and paste the Mathematica code into any version of Mathematica 11+

After running the runner class (Runner), follow the instructions provided by the scanner outputs

Special Cases:
For anything Trig based, typing a: 
S represents Sin[ 
C represents Cos[ 
T represents Tan[ 
A represents Sec[ 
B represents Cot[ 
D represents Csc[ 
Additionally, for any use of pi, type Pi
